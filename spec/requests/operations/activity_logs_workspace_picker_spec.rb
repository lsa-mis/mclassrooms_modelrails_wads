# The workspace filter's reach is `Workspace.kept` — EVERY workspace on the
# instance — so its option list grows with the tenant count, which is the number
# this template exists to grow. Rendering all of them into the filter band put a
# payload on every full-page navigation (sorting and paging both are) that scaled
# with the business.
#
# Above a threshold the control stops being a list and becomes a search. The
# threshold matters because this is a FORK TEMPLATE: nobody is watching a given
# fork's instance to notice the day it crosses the line, so the page has to cross
# it by itself.
#
# Truncating the list silently is NOT the fix and must never become it: a
# workspace missing from a capped list is unselectable with no signal. Every
# example here that caps something also asserts the page SAYS it capped.
