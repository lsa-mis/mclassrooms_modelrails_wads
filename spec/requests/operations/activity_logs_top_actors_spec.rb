# "Who has been busiest here" is usually the first question an operator asks of a
# filtered window, and the ledger could not answer it. Sorting by Who was ruled
# out — actor names are encrypted, so SQL cannot order them — and a sort answers
# the question badly anyway: it clusters names alphabetically and then asks you to
# eyeball which block is tallest, across pages. A count states it.
#
# The strip is a grouped count over the SAME filtered scope the table uses, on an
# indexed integer column. That is what makes it uncapped and correct: it counts
# every matching row, not the rows that happen to be on this page, and only the
# handful of names actually shown are decrypted.
