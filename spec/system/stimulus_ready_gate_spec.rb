# Self-test for the centralized Stimulus barrier in
# spec/support/stimulus_ready.rb. The gate was an allow-list of two paths
# (#525, #837), so 536 `visit` calls across 164 system spec files got no
# wait at all and raced controller boot on loaded shards. #837 asked for the
# gate to be widened rather than annotated call site by call site; these
# examples pin the three properties that makes safe: it covers ordinary app
# paths, it does not wait on a page that has no controllers to wait for, and
# it still fails loud instead of returning a silent false.
