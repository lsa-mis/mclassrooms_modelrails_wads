# cumulative WCAG A/AA/AAA rule stack. axe's `runOnly` tags are NOT
# cumulative — passing only "wcag2aaa" selects just the 3 AAA-tagged rules and
# silently skips the whole A/AA foundation (labels, alt text, names, titles).
# Exactly that regression shipped once (fixed in the #540–#542 arc); this spec
# exists so it can never happen silently again.
#
# It injects a deliberately broken element instead of visiting a real broken
# page — the subject under test is the audit harness itself, not app UI, so
# the project rule "system specs test real rendered HTML" does not apply.
