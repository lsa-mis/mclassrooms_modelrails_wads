# Regression guard for the toast containers' landmark semantics
# (app/views/shared/_toasts.html.erb). These examples deliberately run
# UNSCOPED — whole page, layout chrome included — so a violation on the
# always-rendered containers can never come back unnoticed behind a
# narrowed `include:`.
#
# Per-spec axe runs at the default rule level locally; AAA is a CI-only
# claim (see spec/support/playwright_accessibility.rb) — do not claim AAA
# from a local run.
