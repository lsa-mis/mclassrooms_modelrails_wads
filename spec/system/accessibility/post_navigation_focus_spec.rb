# WCAG 2.4.3 (#424): a Turbo Drive visit replaces the document under the
# user — without a focus move, a keyboard/AT user's focus and virtual cursor
# stay parked on the OLD page's position while new content renders around
# them. Every layout ships `#main-content` with tabindex="-1" as the landing
# target; navigation_focus.js is the global handler that actually lands
# there. Guarded here end-to-end because the failure is invisible to any
# markup-level check.
