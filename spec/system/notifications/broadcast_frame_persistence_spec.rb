# Regression: NotificationBroadcaster refreshed the avatar dot, hamburger dot,
# and user-menu count by `broadcast_replace_to`-ing each <turbo-frame> id with a
# CONTENT-ONLY partial (the partial renders the frame's children, never the frame
# itself). Turbo's `replace` swaps the whole target element, so repeat broadcasts
# could no longer re-target the frame and the surfaces froze after the first
# refresh — the count would show "1 new" forever even as more arrived. The fix is
# `broadcast_update_to` (swap the frame's inner content, keep the frame element).
#
# This spec replays the REAL captured broadcast through the REAL Turbo client
# (window.Turbo.renderStreamMessage) rather than the cable — the test cable
# adapter only records broadcasts, it does not deliver them to the browser — so
# the assertion exercises actual Turbo stream semantics. The bug only manifests
# across TWO consecutive broadcasts, so the test delivers twice and asserts the
# second refresh lands. Capybara's `have_text` auto-waits for Turbo's async
# stream application.
