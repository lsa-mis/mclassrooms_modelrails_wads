# A form rendered INSIDE a <turbo-frame> submits into that frame by default.
# If its controller answers with a redirect, Turbo fetches the target page and
# keeps only the matching frame — the flash, and anything else the layout
# renders outside the frame, is fetched and thrown away. The user acts and
# nothing visibly happens.
#
# The members page has now produced this bug twice: the magic-link generate
# form (fixed when it was written, with a comment saying why) and the
# invitation row's Resend/Revoke buttons (#1038, which shipped broken and was
# only caught by a reviewer's throwaway spec). Second instance of a bug class
# means a guard rather than a third fix (#659).
#
# Static ERB analysis, not a rendered page: a rendered-page walk can only see
# the frames some spec happened to visit, and the states it happened to reach
# (a row's Reactivate button only exists for a discarded member). The template
# text is the whole population and it is deterministic. The cost is the
# analyser below — a small ERB block-depth tracker — and the blind spots listed
# in `unwalked`, which the main failure message prints so nobody has to find
# them here first.
