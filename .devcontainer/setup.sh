echo "=== Running bin/setup ==="
# bin/setup is the canonical Rails entry point. It handles bundle install,

# exec'ing bin/dev inside postCreate (we want the container to come up
# cleanly; the dev runs the server when ready).
bin/setup --skip-server

# The Solid Queue self-heal this script used to carry now runs inside db:prepare
# and db:migrate for everyone (lib/tasks/queue_schema.rake, #1148) — bin/setup
# above has already done it. It lived here alone until then, so a developer
# outside a devcontainer met the failure with no repair and no explanation.

echo "=== Installing Chromium for Cuprite system specs ==="
# System specs drive real headless Chrome via Cuprite/ferrum (pure-Ruby CDP —
# no Node; see spec/support/capybara.rb). CI's ubuntu-latest runners ship Chrome
# pre-installed, but the ruby:slim base does not, so install Debian's chromium
# here (from trixie-security/main) — it lands at /usr/bin/chromium, the name
# ferrum auto-detects on Linux. --no-install-recommends skips ~340 MB of font/
# codec recommends; fonts-liberation is added back for basic text rendering.
# apt-get install is idempotent (no-op once chromium is present).

=== Dev environment ready (GitHub Codespaces) ===

Next steps:
  1. Run: bin/dev
  2. Open the app: click the port 3000 entry in the PORTS panel (or the
     auto-forward notification) — not http://localhost:3000.
  3. Sign in (passwordless): request a magic link, then read it in the dev
     mail inbox — append /letter_opener to your forwarded port 3000 URL
     (dev never sends real email).

.env was created from .env.example; edit it if you need to change any defaults.

=== Dev environment ready ===

Next steps:
  1. Edit .env (copied from .env.example) if you need to change any defaults
  2. Run: bin/dev
  3. Visit: http://localhost:3000

For deployment with Kamal:
  1. Edit config/deploy.yml (server IP, registry, app name)
  2. Set KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in .kamal/secrets
  3. Run: bin/kamal setup
